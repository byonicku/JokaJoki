# Joka Joki
Joka Joki was an app that made for final project of Object Oriented Programming in Universitas Atma Jaya Yogyakarta. Program use is really simple, it can use to manage your "Joki" system in simple way. 
In Indonesia Joki is referenced to people that do other people task to gain money. I used this theme since there's a lot of "Joki" in Indonesia and trying to adapt it to my final project in this group.
